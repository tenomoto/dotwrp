# dotwrp.c

This is a wrapper for all of the BLAS functions in Apple's vecLib Framework
that have compatibility issues between F2C and GNU Fortran.

The functions fixed are:
	cdotc
	cdotu
	zdotc
	zdotu
	sdot
	snrm2
	sasum
	scnrm2
	scasum
All other BLAS routines work correctly with or without the -ff2c flag.

Instead of using this package, you could instead compile your FORTRAN with
-ff2c. However, if your code exports any functions returning single-precision
or (single- or double-precision) complex results, then any code that calls
those functions will be forced to follow F2C conventions as well.

To use, just add dotwrp.c to your existing project, or link to it statically.

This is an expansion of the "dotwrp" project by tenomoto:

We've chosen to convert the f90 code to c so we can take advantage of the 
__attribute__((visibility ("hidden"))) settings. This ensures that the symbols
generated by this code are not visible outside of your project---which is
important if you're mixing multiple FORTRAN-based projects together.
